My original project for my Full Stack Development Diploma was a Todo List, crafted with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm currently elevating the project by implementing React.js and integrating Appwrite for enhanced functionalities like user authentication and database management.

# My Task List

The task list app allows users to create categories and add to-do items for each specific task. The application is developed using React for the front end and Appwrite for the backend.
